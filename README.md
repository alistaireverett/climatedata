This is a developing project which will hopefully provide a portal to a range of climate data which is freely available online.

You can see the current latest stable(ish) version here: http://climateinteractive.herokuapp.com/

For the moment, the project uses the Norwegian Meteorological Institute Frost API and only has access to a small number of stations. In the long run, the idea is that it will be straightforward to add other APIs, plotting functions and capabilities to handle more than just temperature.

Keep checking back for updates!
